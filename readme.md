Hi all,

Here are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

Usually I commit them as is when I submit, and then I may clean the code up as I see fit,
so what you see is not necessarily what I submitted. You may find submitted version
for task 2 of every day in the commit log, but between task 1 and task 2 I don't often
care to commit, so that part is lost.

I don't really know F#, so my code may look or indeed be awful, that's normal.
If you care to let me know how to get better, drop me a message.

Merry Christmas and have fun!

Cheers,

Alexey
